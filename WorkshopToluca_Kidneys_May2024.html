      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This workshop provided participants with a practical overview of kidney segmentation using 3D Slicer. Attendees learned to load medical data, navigate the interface, and use segmentation tools to create accurate 3D models of renal anatomy.</p>
      <p>A workshop was organized by the Medical Bioengineer Enrique Hernandez Laredo, a member of the mexican team. This 3-hour workshop was carried out as part of the dissemination activities. The “Obtaining Three-dimensional Kidney model from CT Imaging” workshop was held at the Universidad del Valle de México in Toluca, State of Mexico. The workshop was attended by 25 sixth-semester students from the Biomedical Engineering Bachelor's program, and was taught in Spanish using the original (English) 3D Slicer 5.6.2 release version, the language selection was due to the lack of a stable internet connection and the time needed to train the users in the Spanish language configuration during the workshop.</p>
