## Installing the extensions
For this workshop, we need to install three extensions: TotalSegmentator, MonaiAuto3DSeg, and LanguagesPacks. 
The first two allow us to run AI models to automatically segment our data, and the last allows us to use Slicer in other languages.

- Click on the extension manager

## Configuring the software language
To use the software in Portuguese, follow these steps. If you want to continue to use English, you can go to the next step, "Loading the model."
- Open the Language Tools module

## Loading the model
This is the most important part that needs to be done before the event; loading a model can take several minutes, and you probably will not have time to do it during the workshop.
- Click on "Download Sample Data."
