            The Slicer for Latin America team presented a poster entitled “Preliminary Results of 3D Slicer Localization to Portuguese and Spanish for the Latin American Biomedical Engineering Community” at the XIX Brazilian Congress of Biomedical Engineering (CBEB2024) September 2-6, 2024, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. The poster lead to discussions on the technical and social aspects of software internationalization. Attendees were particularly interested in the Weblate workflow: how strings are extracted from code, the criteria for becoming a translator, and the process for uploading new content. Beyond the technicalities, we highlighted how English-only software and documentation create significant barriers for the Latin American biomedical community. By localizing these tools, we empower experienced professors and students to share their expertise and contribute to the field.

Joel Zagoya López (collaborator on the project), his area of expertise is design with experience in segmentation and reconstruction of 3D models for 3D printing. This 6-hour workshop was carried out as part of the dissemination activities, and it was held on June 10, 2024 (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8hz3suhibjgz9a4qoxjos/AHhVqWHecLWMzybXX1Nd9DA?rlkey=5ra1kj19wmd6070l5oxb9zwf9&e=1&st=rioowvr2&dl=0" class="hyperlink">Workshop material </a>). This educational event was specifically designed for the students interested in medical imaging. The session had an outstanding attendance of 4 teachers and 17 students eager to acquire knowledge in this cutting-edge area.

            The <a href="WorkshopToluca_Kidneys_May2024.html" class="hyperlink">1st Slicer Toluca Workshop</a> focused on Obtaining 3D models of the kidneys from CT imaging. A workshop was organized by the Medical Bioengineer Enrique Hernandez Laredo, a member of the mexican team. This 3-hour workshop was carried out as part of the dissemination activities, and it was held on May 7th and 14th, 2024. The “Obtaining Three-dimensional Kidney model from CT  Imaging” workshop was held at the Universidad del Valle de México in Toluca, State of Mexico. The workshop was attended by 25 sixth-semester students from the Biomedical Engineering Bachelor's program, and was taught in Spanish using the original (English) 3D Slicer 5.6.2 release version, the language selection was due to the lack of a stable internet connection and the time needed to train the users in the Spanish language configuration during the workshop.

            The <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW40_2024_GranCanaria/" class="hyperlink">PW40</a> was the first event in person, with one Mexican member [Enrique Hernandez Laredo] and two Brazilian members [Lucas Sanchez Silva and Pr. Luiz Otavio Murta Junior] were in person at Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain. The other members were online. The project's progress was presented at the PW39 in January 2024. Among the key achievements is the development of a functional prototype for creating tutorials within 3D Slicer, divided into three main stages:
            
            <ol class="mt-3">
            <li> Generation of tutorials using Python scripts: This stage enables the creation and modification of Screenshots and associated Slicer environment metadata, using the Slicer self-test infrastructure, in an automatic way. So a Python self-test, that describes a use case for Slicer for testing purposes, may also save the necessary information for a tutorial creation in a language-independent format.
            </li>
            <li>Generation of annotations: A graphical interface integrated into 3D Slicer allows the placement of various types of annotations, including arrows, circles, rectangles, and text, directly onto the interface.</li>
            <li>Painter: The final stage retrieves information from the previous stages to accurately reconstruct annotations, addressing challenges related to dimensions and button positions across different languages.
